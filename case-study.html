                    <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                    <p>This project created the client-side single-page application of a movies-based project.  It used a 
                    React library for the View aspect of the MVC architecture.  The application allows a user to 
                    register as a new user or log in using JWT authentication and then access a MongoDB database through
                    a RESTful API.  The user views movies from the database and can obtain additional details about the director
                    and genre of each movie.

                    <h3>Purpose and Context</h3>
                    <p>This project was part of my student work for learning React and associated libraries and technologies 
                    (including React Router, create-react-app, Redux and React Bootstrap).  It allowed me to practice new
                    technologies as well as develop a single-page application to interact with the RESTful API that I created.</p>

                    <h3>Objective</h3>
                    <p>This project provides a single-page application in which a user can create an account and login to
                        access a database of movie information as well as see a list of their favorite movies.  The user
                        can obtain details about the genre and director for each movie from the database.

                        <h3>Approach</h3>
                        <p>This project used React, React Router, create-react-app, React Bootstrap, Sasa, and Axios.  To create 
                            a solution for this project I researched how a single-page application works and studied how to use
                            React and Redux for it. I looked at several examples using React to get a better understanding of its use
                            of components for the user interface.  I also examined create-react-app, React Bootstrap and Axios examples 
                            to ensure that I was using these boilerplates and libraries correctly in my project.  I sketched out how the 
                            different components should interact and worked through the details for implementing this project.

                    working for this project.

                            <p>This project provided me with plenty of challenges in the form of learning opportunities and allowed me 
                                to gain a better understanding of React, React Router, and React Redux.<br>
                                My overall challenge was in getting a strong understanding of how React works with states and props and 
                                layered on top of that was a mental shift for using React Redux.  I struggled to learn the workings
                                of React and Redux from the class instructions and gained a much stronger understanding by sketching out how 
                                the different parts were supposed to interact with a lot of help from tutorials on the web.  I then used plenty
                                of print statements (console.log() calls) to follow what was being passed to and from React components and to
                                ensure that what I intended to happen was actually doing so.
                                It took a while to understand the use of states and props and how action-types, action-creators, and reducers
                                tied it all to Redux.

                                <h3>Duration</h3>
                                <p>I had expected this project to take 30 to 40 hours to complete.  Hah!  I reality I spent almost 16 hours fighting
                                    with my Windows OS to get create-react-app working before switching over to a MacOS.  My challenges with learning 
                                    React and React Redux added another 30 hours to this project resulting in about 80 hours of work to complete it.
